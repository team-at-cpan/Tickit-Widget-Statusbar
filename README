NAME

    Tickit::Widget::Statusbar - provides a simple status bar implementation

SYNOPSIS

     my $statusbar = Tickit::Widget::Statusbar->new;
     $statusbar->update_status('Ready to start');

DESCRIPTION

    Provides a status bar, typically for use at the bottom of the terminal
    to indicate when we're busy doing something. You'll probably want this
    as the last widget in a Tickit::Widget::VBox with expand omitted or set
    to 0.

    Currently the statusbar contains the status text, a memory usage
    indicator (VSZ), CPU usage, and a clock. It should also allow progress
    bars, sparklines, and the ability to configure things, but as yet it
    does not.

METHODS

    Not too many user-serviceable parts inside as yet. This is likely to
    change in future.

 new

    Instantiates the status bar.

 update_status

    Set current status. Takes a single parameter - the string to set the
    status to.

    Returns $self.
